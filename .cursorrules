# Coding Rules for Not Your Thoughts Project

## Code Quality Rules

### 1. No Unused Variables

- Always check for unused variables when suggesting changes
- Remove any unused imports, variables, or functions
- Use linter to identify unused code

### 2. No IIFEs in JSX

- Never use Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) in JSX
- Extract complex logic into separate functions
- Keep JSX clean and readable
- Example of what NOT to do:
  ```jsx
  <div>
    {(() => {
      const result = someComplexLogic()
      return result
    })()}
  </div>
  ```
- Example of what TO do:
  ```jsx
  const getResult = () => {
    const result = someComplexLogic()
    return result
  }
  ;<div>{getResult()}</div>
  ```

### 3. Function Extraction

- Extract reusable logic into utility functions
- Create helper functions for complex calculations
- Use descriptive function names
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Avoid calling expensive functions multiple times in render
- Use useMemo or useCallback when appropriate
- Extract calculations outside of JSX when possible

### 5. Code Organization

- Group related functions together
- Place utility functions near the top of components
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
